                        <p>This is a great hike for a chill Sunday afternoon. It’s not too long, about 4 hours (closer to 5 if you’re like us and you stop for a relaxed picnic lunch with a view), not too difficult, and there are plenty of lovely sights to keep you entertained as you go. </p>

                        <img src="img/helere-vineyard.png">

                        <p><strong>Who is this hike for?</strong> If you’re looking for something vigorous to get the heart rate going, this probably isn’t what you’re looking for. Unless you want to run it. To each their own. For us, this was more of a leisurely, stroll along with a thermos of bourbon-spiked hot chocolate as you take in the sights, type of hike. </p>

                        <p>The elevation change is only about 310m (1017ft), or roughly 100 flights of stairs. Spread that out over 11.64 km, and the intensity is quite low. There were really only one or two moments that got the glutes burning a bit. </p>

                        <p><strong>What can you expect to see?</strong> The cool thing about this one is that you’ll get a nice variety of surroundings. The main highlights are some great views of the Pyrenees (always breathtaking), and a walk through the peaceful vineyards of Jurançon. </p>

                        <p>You’ll spend most of your time on dirt paths, transitioning in and out of the forest, although from time to time you’ll hit some pavement. It’s more like a countryside tour of farm houses and pastures than a rustic trail. But still well worth doing. Many of the houses and properties are simply charming. I started envisioning us living in one of them and taking our horses out for trail rides on the weekends… </p>

                        <p>As promised, the real reward for your efforts of the day comes during the last 30-45 minutes, when you step into the rolling hills of Jurançon and make your way through the region’s lush vineyards. If you’re a photography enthusiast, or you’re looking for some great shots for your Instagram account, this is the perfect opportunity.</p>

                        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Bring a bit of cash with you, because when you’re all done for the day, you can treat yourself to a refreshing beer at the local bar that’s conveniently placed right next to the starting-point parking lot. After nearly 5 hours of walking, it was the best €2 Heineken I’ve ever tasted.</p>

                        <p><strong>As always</strong>, be sure to bring enough water to get you through the entire hike, and remember that it’s better to err on the side of more. Especially if it’s a hot day. </p>

                        <p>And please be responsible and respectful of our environment. We want to see the views, not your rubbish. So if you bring it on the hike, make sure it goes back with you. </p>

                        <p>Thanks for reading and happy hiking!</p>
